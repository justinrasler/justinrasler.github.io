## Pokemon Index

## features:
diplays basic stats for pokemon such as:
- health
- height
- weight
- attack power
- defense
- pokemon type
- xp

It also has tidbits for each div table.

## problems faced
I was trying to add the evolutions of each pokemon to the side of displayed stats, but I couldn't figure out how to add a separate link
